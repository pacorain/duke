wellness_reminder:
  - We have a pretty nifty website and blog you can check out at https://www.houseofmisfits.org
  - "If you'd like to donate to House of Misfits, type donate in #ch_botspam# and my friend, Toriel, will walk you through the rest. Thank you!"
  - "If this channel is getting too wild/crazy for you... try #ch_quiet# chat."
  - Cake is our server's currency. It can be picked by talking in this channel and earned by participating in events. You can spend your cake in the Spend Cake category.
  - "Have a question but not sure who to ask? Head to #ch_helpdesk# with your question and a staff member will answer shortly."
  - HEY! Everybody take a minute to drink a glass of water. That's all. And if you forgot to take your meds today, this is your reminder.
  - "Want to say something nice, encouraging, positive, or wholesome to another member but don't want to come off creepy or initiate awkward conversation? Send them an anonymous #ch_happy_letter#"
  - Your reminder to drink water! If you hate water, put some fruit in it or add a splash of juice or water flavorer.
  - Do you take vitamins or supplements for your health? Don't forget to take them today and keep your body healthy.
  - Get up and do a little exercise. Stretch, go for a 10-minute walk, do some jumping jacks - get your blood pumping. A little goes a long way. The server will still be here when you come back.
