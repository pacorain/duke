discord_tip:
  - Have y'all planned a game night? You should. It would be totally fun.
  - Want to mention a group of people at once but too lazy to type them all out? Use a role! For example, to exclude Austin because he's not a part of the blood pact, you can mention `@OG Rainwater`
  - Something on your mind? Not sure where to put it? You can make a new channel! For example, I might make a channel called \#fucking-karen because I'm tired of Karen and all her complaining about saturated fats at work.
  - You can change your nickname at any time. Want to be called "shrinkwrap"? Set your nickname to that! It only applies to this server.
  - Tired of hearing about Austin and his stupid work-life-balance or whatever? You can set up a channel to never send you notifications, or mute it entirely and it will never be marked as unread!
  - Jasmine has a "remind" command! Type `.remind me 1h do the thing` to set up a reminder in an hour. Or, you can annoy everyone in the channel by saying `.remind here 2d5m @everyone penis`.
  - Thinking about making a passive-aggressive comment on the server? Don't. Fucking @ them you coward.
  - Each person has a color role. Want to change your color? Go to "Server Settings" and then "Roles".
  - Jasmine (both the dog and the bot) will react to certain phrases. Want to add one? Use the `.acr` command. Type `.help acr` in <\#664318981225709588> for more info.
  - Need Jasmine to look up a picture for you and put it on the server? Try `.img cats with hats` to see pictures of cats with hats.
  - We can listen to music together! Type `!help` in <\#680803437104988170> to get a list of commands for the Rythm music bot.
  - There's not enough emoji on the server. Would any of you be willing to add some more?
